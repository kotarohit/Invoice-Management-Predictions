<Invoice Management Predictions>
This application has been developed for businesses with a focus on improving the efficiency of their account receivable department. Specifically, it is designed to help B2B organizations keep track of their customers' account clearance dates.

As part of their regular operations, seller businesses engage with various other businesses and sell them goods at different times. To ensure proper accounting, the seller needs to monitor all the invoices from the buyers, which include details such as payment due date, invoice date, invoice amount, baseline date, and other relevant information.

The purchasers are required to clear the payable amount before the due date, but in reality, invoices are not always paid in full by the due date. The payment date, which refers to the date on which a customer pays the invoice, can vary. The application helps to track payment dates to ensure accurate account receivable management.
